Filtering lists.
================

list : filter (1 to 100) by (x) where
	(x) is divisible by 5

showline (list) as list
showline (x)

(number) is not divisible by any in (list):
	for each (divisor) in (list)
		show {divisor, " "}
		if ((number) is divisible by (divisor))
			return false
		true

Primes to 100.
==============

primes : {2, 3, 5, 7}

list : filter (8 to 100) by (x) where
	(x) is not divisible by any in (primes)

primes : join (primes) and (list)

. without the newline this crashes with an access violation
. when run in the combined test program
.new line
showline (primes) as list
showline (list) as list
