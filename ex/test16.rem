	$x is divisible by 5

showline $list as list
showline $x

	for each $divisor in $list
		show {$divisor, " "}
		if ($number is divisible by $divisor)
			return false
		true

Primes to 100.
==============

$primes : {2, 3, 5, 7}

$list : filter (8 to 100) by $x where
	$x is not divisible by any in $primes

$primes : join $primes and $list

showline $primes as list
showline $list as list
