Calculate primes.
=================

$primes : {2}


$number is not divisible by any number in $list :
	for each $divisor in $list
		if ($number is divisible by $divisor)
			return false
		true

{ length of $primes, " prime: ", $primes as list } ↲

for each $i from 1 to 3
	
	$biggest-prime : last in $primes
	$start : $biggest-prime + 1
	$finish : ($biggest-prime × $biggest-prime) + 1
	
	$the-list : $start to $finish
	$more-primes : filter $the-list by $x where
		$x is not divisible by any number in $primes
	
	$primes : join $primes and $more-primes
	
	{ length of $primes, " primes: ", $primes as list } ↲
