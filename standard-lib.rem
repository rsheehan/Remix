========================================

Shorthand for "if (not ()) []".
Transparent like "if".
if not (condition)(block)::
	if (not (condition))
		do (block)

Repeat the "block" for ever.
repeat (block) forever:
	do (block)

Repeat the "block" a definite number of times.
repeat (count) times (block):
	if (count ≤ 0)
		return last
	last : do (block)
	count : count - 1
	redo

Alternative definite repeat.
repeat (block)(count) times:
	repeat (count) times (block)

While a "condition" is true keep doing "block".
while (condition) repeat (block):
	if not (condition)
		return last
	last : do (block)
	redo

Catch the result of "block" even if a "return" is used.
catch do (block):
	do (block)

An alternative name for return without a value, i.e. none.
This is more applicable when breaking out from within a loop or a sequence statement.
break out::
	return

Repeat a "block" until some "condition" is true.
repeat (block) until (condition):
	last : do (block)
	if (condition)

	redo

========================================

starting with (start-block) repeat (block)(count) times:
	do (start-block)
	repeat (count) times (block)

starting with (start-block) repeat (count) times (block):
	do (start-block)

	while (condition) repeat (block)

========================================

Run "block" for each item in "list".
"block" will refer to "item".

for each (#item) in (list)(block):
	start (list)

		if (end of (list))
			return last
		#item : next (list)
		A return in the (block) following breaks out of the loop, with its result.
		last : do (block)
		redo

A for each with a definite "start" and "finish" value.
for each (#item) from (start) to (finish) (block):
	for each (#item) in ((start) to (finish)) (block)

A for each with "start", "finish" and a "step".
for each (#item) from (start) to (finish) in steps of (step) (block):
	list : (start) to (finish)
	start (list)
	do
		if (end of (list))
			return last
		#item : next(list)
		last : do (block)
		repeat (step - 1) times

		if (condition)
			break out
		append (#item) to (new-list)
	new-list

.Create a new list by applying a block to each element of a list.
.Each "x" value in the block is replaced by each element in turn.
.I really need to consider whether this is a good idea.
.The x value is a top-level value and overwrites an existing x.
.apply (x-block) to (list):
.	result : {}
.	for each (x) in (list)
.		append (do (x-block)) to (result)
.	result

Create a new list by applying "block" to each element of "list".
Uses the variable name passed as #item.
apply (block) to each (#item) from (list):
	result : {}
	for each (#item) in (list)
		append (do (block)) to (result)
	result

apply (block) (n) times:
	result : {}
	repeat (n) times
		append (do (block)) to (result)

========================================

The "options-block" is a sequence of "[condition] do [block]" statements.
Optionally followed by a default statement.
Unlike a simple "do" this function catches any "break out" calls.
choose from (options-block):
	do (options-block)
Note the :: in the following function definition.
(condition) do (block)::
	if (condition)
		return do (block)
		.break out

See ex/middle.
(condition) produces (result)::
	if (condition)
		return result

Return true if all blocks in the {list-of-blocks} are true.
all of (list-of-blocks):
	for each (item-block) in (list-of-blocks)
		if not (item-block)
			return false
		true

Return true if any block in the {list-of-blocks} are true.
any of (list-of-blocks):
	for each (item-block) in (list-of-blocks)
		if (item-block)
			return true
		false

Transparent like "if".
if any of (list-of-blocks) (consequence)::
	if (any of (list-of-blocks)) 
		do (consequence)

Compare the above with this to see different approaches to the "consequence".

if all of (list-of-blocks) (consequence)::
	if (all of (list-of-blocks)) (consequence)

========================================

A variant of append.
add the (item) to (collection):
	append (item) to (collection)

	result : "{"
	for each (item) in (list)

			append ((item) as list) to (result)
		] otherwise [
			append ' to (result) if (item) string
			append (convert (item) to string) to (result)
			append ' to (result) if (item) string
		]
		if (not at end of (list))
			append ", " to (result)
	append "}" to (result)

Only used in (list) as list.

		show (object [n])
		if (n ≠ length of (object))
			show ", "
	show "}"

showline (object) as object:

		item : 0
	] apply [sum : sum + item] on each (item) in (list)
